# Installing Go

The most recent version of Go is 1.25 (August 2025).
If your system already comes with a version of Go, you may check your version like this:

```sh
go version
```

We recommend installing the latest version of Go.

The Go team provides install instructions for the most common platforms on the [Go website](https://go.dev/doc/install).

To get started with Go, you should read the [Getting Started](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started) tutorial on the Go website.

If the above instructions do not work for you, please ask the TA for help.
