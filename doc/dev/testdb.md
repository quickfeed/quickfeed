# Test Database

The `test.db` database uses the updated Quickfeed schema without any json-encoded string fields.
Hence, the `DisableForeignKeyConstraintWhenMigrating` (`gormdb.go:48`) should not be set to true.

- The easiest way to inspect or edit the database is to use a sqlite database browser GUI, for example the [DB Browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) or the `sqlite3` command-line tool.

- User with ID 1 is a super user registered as `CourseCreator` of all courses in the database.
  The `RemoteIdentity` record for this user can be replaced with GitHub's remote ID and access token of your GitHub user to login as super user. Additionally, replace `login` field of the `User` record with your GitHub login.
  
  To update with the command-line tool:

  ```sql
  sqlite3 test.db
  update remote_identities
  set remote_id = {id: int}, access_token = {token: string}
  where id = 1;

  update users
  set login = {login: string}
  where id = 1;
  ```

- Course with ID 1 is based on the [qf406](https://github.com/qf406) organization created specifically for testing purposes.
  This organization can be used for any kind of testing: adding or removing users and groups, adding assignments and tests, pushing submissions to student repos and so on.
  Request an invite to the repository if you want to use it for testing.
