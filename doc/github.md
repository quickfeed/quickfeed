# GitHub Setup

## Generating API Keys for Connecting to GitHub

The first step is to create a new API key for your QuickFeed application.

1. Decide which GitHub account to use for connecting your QuickFeed server to GitHub.
   - For development, using a private GitHub account is fine.
   - For deployment, we recommend creating a separate GitHub account.
2. Log in to your chosen GitHub account.
3. Click your profile picture and select Settings.
4. In Settings, click Developer Settings and create a [New OAuth App](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app).
    1. Name your application, e.g., `QuickFeed Development`.
    2. Homepage URL should be your public landing page for QuickFeed, e.g., `https://uis.itest.run/`.
    3. Authorization callback URL must be unique for each instance of QuickFeed, e.g., `https://uis.itest.run/auth/github/callback`.
5. When you click Register application, you will be able to retrieve your Client ID and Client Secret.
   These are necessary for QuickFeed to access GitHub, and for GitHub to communicate back to the QuickFeed server.
   Create a shell script `quickfeed-env.sh` and copy the Client ID and Client Secret values as shown below:

   ```sh
   export GITHUB_KEY="Client ID"
   export GITHUB_SECRET="Client Secret"
   ```

6. Then, to start the QuickFeed server:

   ```sh
   % source quickfeed-env.sh
   % quickfeed -service.url uis.itest.run &> quickfeed.log &
   ```

   The first GitHub user to login becomes admin for the server.

   Note that the `-service.url` should not be specified with the `https://` prefix.

## Creating a Course
