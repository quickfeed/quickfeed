                    QuickFeed is a tool for providing automated feedback to students on their lab assignments.
                    QuickFeed builds upon version control systems and continuous integration.
                    When students upload code to their repositories, QuickFeed automatically builds their code and provides feedback based on tests supplied by the teaching staff.
                    When grading assignments, teaching staff can access the results of test execution and have a valuable tool in the grading process.
